If you've ever used a Pi-hole, you know that it's the absolute best way to block ads. One problem many people have with the Pi-hole, however, is that it's so good that it almost comes as a shock when you sign into a different network and start getting ads again! This guide will walk you through setting up a portable Pi-hole so that you can have protection against ads no matter what network you're using.

Setting this up is simple enough:

 - Download and run PH4WSL1.cmd (either from this repository or its [original repository](https://github.com/DesktopECHO/Pi-Hole-for-WSL1))
 - Download Pi-hole_launcher.bat and paste this in C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup - be sure to replace "your_username" with your username or find the folder manually!
 - Configure your computer to use itself as its DNS server. To do this:
   - test
